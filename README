File: parsedata.m
	* This file handles the parsing of the original data
	from the daily reports that we recieve from BIM.
	
	* This file takes a long time to run as it is parsing
	over a lot of data and currently creating a file for
	each unqiue website it finds. I am going to look into
	improving the speed of this file eventually.
	
File: volume_revenue.m
	* This file reads in one of the particular website files
	generated from parsedata.m and graphs revenue vs. time,
	volume vs. time and mean revenue vs. time.
	
	* I have it set to only read in 10000 lines from a file
	as this is enough data to generate the graphs. However,
	it can also be bumped higher if desired. (I originally
	ran it with 1000000 but the graphs don't look significantly
	different from the ones genereated with only 10000 data
	points)
	
File: dlmcell.m
	* Open source file I found that handles writing a cell
	array out to a file in a clean fashion.
	
File: _<website url>_
	* These contain all the data for one day of the website
	with the name <website url>. These are the files to read
	from when using volume_revenue.m to graph data.
